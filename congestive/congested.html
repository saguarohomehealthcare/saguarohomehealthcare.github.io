            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
            <p>Known as chronic heart failure or congestive cardiac failure. A condition that the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently in your body. The heart's main pumping chambers become thicker or larger, and hence can't relax or contract as they should. This leads to fluid retention in the lungs, abdomen, legs and other parts of the body.</p>

            <h3 id="affect">How does Congestive Heart Failure affect your body?</h3>
            <p>Heart failure affects the body by placing stress on other organs. The body compensates for poor heart function in the short term by releasing the hormone adrenaline (epinephrine) so the heart pumps faster and with greater force. As the heart works harder, the heart walls thicken and become stiff reducing its ability to pump blood to the body. Blood that is not pumped to the body builds up behind heart valves causing damage. The body compensates to the reduced blood flow by increasing the volume of blood by limiting the amount of salts released in the urine. The excess salt content in the blood places strain on the kidneys, leading to kidney damage or failure. The greater volume of blood in the heart can stretch the heart muscle, weakening it further. Excess fluids in the body can also put stress on the liver resulting in liver damage.</p>

              <p>At first you may not have any symptoms from heart failure. For a while, your heart and body can make up for heart failure. For example, your heart can pump faster and pump more blood with each beat. This is called compensation. But as your heart has more trouble pumping enough blood to your body, you will likely have symptoms. These symptoms may get worse or change if your heart failure gets worse. Symptoms of heart failure start to happen when your heart can't pump enough blood to the rest of your body</p>

            <p>Pathophysiology or physiopathology is a convergence of pathology with physiology. Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state, whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Pathology describes the abnormal or undesired condition, whereas pathophysiology seeks to explain the physiological processes or mechanisms whereby such condition develops and progresses.</p>

					      <td>Diuretics, in conjunction with restriction of dietary sodium and fluids, often lead to clinical improvement in patients with stages I and II HF. In general, type and dosage of diuretic depend on cause and degree of HF and state of renal function. Preload reduction is most useful in treating patients with a relatively normal cardiac output accompanied by congestive symptoms. Loop diuretics block chloride reabsorption, thus interfering with the reabsorption of sodium and water.</td>

					    	<td>Vasodilators: nitrates (Nitro-Dur, Isordil); arterial dilators: hydralazine (Apresoline); combination drugs: prazosin (Minipress)</td>
					    	<td>Vasodilators are the mainstay of treatment in HF and are used to increase cardiac output, reducing circulating volume (venodilators) and decreasing SVR, thereby reducing ventricular workload. Note: Parenteral vasodilators (Nitroprusside) are reserved for patients with severe HF or those unable to take oral medications.</td>

					    	<td>Inotropic agents: amrinone (Inocor), milrinone (Primacor), vesnarinone (Arkin-Z)</td>
					    	<td>These medications are useful for short-term treatment of HF unresponsive to cardiac glycosides, vasodilators, and diuretics in order to increase myocardial contractility and produce vasodilation. Positive inotropic properties have reduced mortality rates 50% and improved quality of life.</td>

					    </tr>
					    <tr>
					    	<td>Administer IV solutions, restricting total amount as indicated. Avoid saline solutions.</td>
					    	<td>Because of existing elevated left ventricular pressure, patient may not tolerate increased fluid volume (preload). Patients with HF also excrete less sodium, which causes fluid retention and increases myocardial workload.</td>
					    </tr>
					    <tr>
					    	<td>Monitor and replace electrolytes.</td>
					    	<td>Fluid shifts and use of diuretics can alter electrolytes (especially potassium and chloride), which affect cardiac rhythm and contractility.</td>

					    <tr>
					    	<td>Monitor serial ECG and chest x-ray changes.</td>
					    	<td>ST segment depression and T wave flattening can develop because of increased myocardial oxygen demand, even if no coronary artery disease is present. Chest x-ray may show enlarged heart and changes of pulmonary congestion.</td>

					    	<td>Measure cardiac output and other functional parameters as indicated.</td>
					    	<td>Cardiac index, preload, afterload, contractility, and cardiac work can be measured noninvasively by using thoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) technique. Useful in determining effectiveness of therapeutic interventions and response to activity.</td>

A battery-powered ventricular assist device (VAD) may also be used, positioned between the cardiac apex and the descending thoracic or abdominal aorta. This device receives blood from the left ventricle (LV) and ejects it into the systemic circulation, often allowing patient to resume a nearly normal lifestyle while awaiting heart transplantation.
