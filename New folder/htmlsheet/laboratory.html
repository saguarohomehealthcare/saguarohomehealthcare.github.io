			<ul>
				<li>Meeting the demands and challenges of diagnostic testing</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Begins before birth and frequently continues even after death.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Testing before birth: amniocentesis, fetal ultrasound, and genetic testing</li>
								<li>Testing after death: autopsy, organ transplant, death reporting, and evidentiary or forensic testing</li>

							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>Nurses need a sound knowledge and practice base to provide safe, effective care and to bring their unique caring qualities to the diagnostic testing event. The nursing process is a necessary, integral, and ongoing care planning and providing component because the nursing process is the nursing frame of reference and foundation for all nursing practice. The sequence of assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, intervention, and implementation of the plan, together with evaluation, are all necessary sequential steps. Application of the nursing process to diagnostic testing facilitates and establishes a framework and comprehensive plan to provide safe, competent care.</li>

		<h1>Home Care Environment</h1>
		<img src="img10/nurse3.png">
		<p>The trend toward shorter hospitalizations for acute illnesses has created a need for continued care in the home setting. The nurse uses astute clinical decision-making skills and recognizes when to initiate physician contact to confirm the need for specific laboratory and diagnostic tests to avoid illness complications, as well as unnecessary exposure, transfer, and hospital admission costs.</p>
		<p>Specimen collection and testing vary according to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Home health care agency policies</li>
				<li>Home location</li>
				<li>Nursing skills</li>
				<li>Physician’s preference</li>
				<li>Nature of the illness</li>
				<li>The degree to which immediate intervention is necessary</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Nurse must be skilled in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Drawing venous blood</li>
				<li>Collecting specimens from invasive lines (or catheters)</li>
				<li>Obtaining cultures</li>
				<li>Proper labeling</li>
				<li>Documenting</li>
				<li>Handling</li>
				<li>Transporting of specimens</li>
				<li>Teaching the patient and significant others how to correctly collect and preserve specimens</li>
				<li>knowing the patient’s cultural and alternative therapeutic practices to facilitate appropriate diagnostic testing procedures and evaluations</li>
			</ul>
		<p>In urban or suburban areas, the health care agency frequently contracts with other providers for specimen collection, analysis, and issuing of reported findings.</p>
		<p>As the care coordinator, the nurse must obtain test results in a timely manner and communicate these findings to the proper clinicians as soon as possible. Test results frequently validate new diagnoses, confirm the need to change medication or dosage, or alert the need for an appointment with the clinician to further.</p>
		<p>The home health care nurse may need to perform selective procedures, procure specimens, or monitor   health problems as shown in the following examples:</p>

		<h1>Long-Term Care Environments</h1>
		<p>With increasing numbers of younger people with complex problems, greater numbers of older adults (those who live into their 90s and 100s), and sick and frail elderly in long-term care settings, nurses play a dynamic role in promoting optimal health status for residents of these facilities while also dealing with ethical and legal issues.</p>
		<p>Changes and challenges in long-term care include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There are more patients with multiple systemic and degenerative problems for which there are no cures.</li>
				<li>Increasing numbers of residents with “full code” (ie, to be resuscitated) status lead to greater volumes and varieties of tests, which raises costs of care.</li>
				<li>Increased awareness of residents’ rights (eg, right to refuse tests) and signed advance directive documents allow more decision making by residents and families.</li>
				<li>More pretest, posttest, and follow-up care procedures occur in nursing homes because residents are frequently transferred to hospitals or clinics only for the more complex procedures, such as computed tomography (CT), endoscopy, and angiography. Intra-test care includes performing or assisting with procedures such as performing fingersticks for blood glucose monitoring, assisting with x-ray films after falls and compromised respiratory occurrences (eg, pneumonia), and obtaining portable electrocardiograms (ECGs) for the onset of chest pain in a patient with a history of cardiac disease and no recent ECG records.</li>
				<li>More confused, combative, or uncooperative behaviors are being cared for in long-term care facilities, and many of these behaviors are related to changes associated with longevity and the aging process; chronic or degenerative diseases; dementia, lack of knowledge, motivation, and concern; and relocation syndrome (ie, moving from one environment to another). Frequently, an attitude of “not wanting to be bothered,” fear of findings and treatment, or outright refusal to have tests done make testing difficult. The nurse must understand the meaning of the patient’s behaviors, provide the patient with an age-friendly environment to foster safety and comfort, and incorporate appropriate communication strategies and nursing interventions for these special populations.</li>

		<h1>The Nurse's Role</h1>
		<img src="img10/nurse4.png">
		<h2>Nursing Practice Standard</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The nurse should follow proper procedures and guidelines for collecting, handling, and transporting specimens, at the same time being cognizant of standard precautions and sterile techniques.</li>
				<li>Nursing interventions include collecting proper specimen amounts, using appropriate containers and media, processing specimens correctly, and storing and transporting specimens within specified time lines.</li>
				<li>Explaining procedures to the patient or family in appropriate terminology, taking into account cultural background, developmental level, and socioeconomic factors, normally elicits cooperation and understanding of the collection process and procedures within the pretest, intra-test, and posttest periods.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Overview of Nursing Responsibilities</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The nurse’s role varies according to:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Specimen type</li>
						<li>Test purpose</li>
						<li>Patient age and gender</li>
						<li>Health status</li>
						<li>clinical setting</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Specific protocols for nursing are governed by the setting in which the testing is done.</li>
				<li>Appropriate skills and practical methods for educating patients and coordinating teamwork are necessary for smooth functioning.</li>
				<li>Specimens collected can include blood, urine, stool, sputum, oral fluids, tissue, hair, and nails. Adherence to principles, protocols, and standards related to specimen collection prevents invalid test results, specimen rejection, and patient injury and mitigates health hazards because of excessive blood draws, infection, and psycho- logical stress.</li>
				<li>Use of interpretive reports</li>
					<ul>
						<li>provide an explanation or reason for an abnormal result, along with suggestions for additional testing and the need for immediate treatment or follow-up.</li>
						<li>often used in conjunction with toxicology, endocrinology, and hematology test results. The use of interpretive reports has been shown to improve patient care and outcome</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

	<div class="container" id="interventions">
		<h1>Nursing Interventions</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Interfering Factors</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Incorrect specimen amounts and collection</li>
						<li>Improper handling and labeling</li>
						<li>Wrong preservative or lack of preservative</li>
						<li>Delayed delivery</li>
						<li>Improper storage (eg, improper temperature or container) or transport of the specimen</li>
						<li>Clotting of whole-blood specimens or hemolysis of blood</li>
						<li>Incomplete specimen collection</li>
						<li>Incorrect or incomplete patient preparation</li>
						<li>Other factors that can alter test results include</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Pretest</li>
								<li>Diet</li>
								<li>Pregnancy</li>
								<li>Time of delay</li>
								<li>Age and gender</li>
								<li>Drug and alcohol ingestion history</li>
								<li>Plasma volume</li>
								<li>Past and present illness or current health status</li>
								<li>Incomplete patient knowledge, understanding, or compliance</li>
								<li>Body position or activity at the time of specimen collection</li>
								<li>Physical or emotional stress</li>
								<li>Noncompliance (not following pretest instructions)</li>
								<li>Fasting or non-fasting status</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>Preparation of the Patient</li>
				<p>When in doubt about withholding medication, confer with the laboratory staff and the patient’s physician</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fasting</li>
						<li>Special Diets</li>
						<li>Activity restrictions</li>
						<li>Withholding of selected medications</li>
						<li>Other special preparations are some pretest phase components</li>
						<li>Isolation precautions must be observed when necessary. Mandatory standard precautions must prevail at all times</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Legal Implications Related to Specimen Collection</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Patient’s right to information</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Knowing the purpose</li>
								<li>Knowing the risks</li>
								<li>Knowing the outcome of the test. </li>
							</ul>
						<li>A properly signed and witnessed consent form may be required.</li>
						<li>Drug abuse testing involves unique protocols. For instance, legal chain of custody may be required to protect the specimen for drug testing. This means that each time the specimen is transferred, the person receiving it becomes the documented holder of the specimen and therefore becomes responsible for the specimen’s integrity. It may be necessary to verify the patient’s identity by photograph for validation before collecting the specimen and at every other stage of the process.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Ethical Implications - Confidentiality must be maintained.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Obtaining specimens for HIV testing or genomic studies (gene sequencing).</li>
						<li>Reporting certain infectious diseases to state and federal centers for disease control may be mandatory, even if the patient objects.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Safety Measures</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Patient safety and well-being should be optimized by preventing or detecting complications.</li>
						<li>Before and after testing, the patient’s behavior, complaints, appearance, and degree of compliance should be observed and documented.</li>
						<li>Nurses also are at risk for infection when procuring, handling, and processing specimens and need to observe standard precautions.</li>
						<li>Protocols for dealing with spillage need to be clearly stated.</li>
						<li>Other issues to consider are electrical and fire safety, proper use of supplies, equipment, handling of radioac- tive materials, and disposition of biohazard materials and sharps.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Infection Control and Standard Precautions</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Standard precautions are always followed according to government Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) standards.</li>
						<li>Appropriate protective clothing and personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used</li>
						<li>Isolation precautions should be followed according to the type of infection identified or suspected per hospital and governmental regulations (eg, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]).</li>
						<li>The importance of proper hand-washing cannot be overemphasized.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Storage and Transportation of Specimens</li>
				<p>Routines for specimen collection, processing, handling, temperature storage, and transportation may vary depending on agency protocols and clinical settings. The primary objectives in the storage and transport of diagnostic specimens are to maintain the integrity of the sample and to minimize hazards to the specimen handlers. Specimens should be collected and transported as quickly as possible (within 2 hours is recommended). The nurse must follow instructions carefully.</p>
				<li>Immediate Specimen Transport</li>
					<ul>
						<li>After the specimen is collected, it should be placed in a biohazard bag and transported to the laboratory immediately for prompt processing and analysis to prevent specimen deterioration.</li>
						<li>If the blood sample cannot be transported to the laboratory in a reasonable time, the blood can be centrifuged to prevent deterioration of the specimen, or refrigerated or placed on ice.</li>
						<li>Consult with laboratory personnel for proper storage and temperature.</li>
						<li>Unacceptable specimens lead to increased costs and wasted time for everyone concerned, including the third-party payer.</li>
						<li>Exposure to sunlight, warming, cooling, and air or other substances can all alter specimen integrity.</li>
						<li>“STAT” tests should always be hand- carried to the laboratory, processed immediately, and documented as such in the health care record.</li>
						<li>Transport From Non-acute Care Settings to the Laboratory</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>As the trend shifts toward specimen collection in the community, nursing home, clinics, physician offices, and private home care environments, the nurse working in these areas needs to be aware of the procedures and protocols for specimen collection, handling, transport, and, in some cases, actual specimen measurement, that is, point-of-care testing (POCT). The movement toward POCT is an effort to expand and improve the quality of care, health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
			<p>The specimen should be placed in a biohazard bag. Include clearly written instructions and specific directions to the laboratory.</p>
			<p>Specimens are also often mailed or transported to specialty laboratories in other areas. To avoid delays in analysis and in reporting the results, follow specific instructions and label correctly.</p>
			<p>Exact time frames must be observed. Transport to Special Laboratories</p>
			<p>When shipping specimens to specialty laboratories, place the specimen in a securely closed, leak-proof, nonbreakable container such as a test tube, vial, or other appropriate receptacle (ie, primary container). Enclose this primary container within a second, durable, leak-proof container (ie, secondary container). Together, these primary and secondary containers should then be enclosed in a sturdy, strong, outer shipping container.</p>
			<p>Appropriately label biologic and tissue agents or biomedical mate- rial. If the package becomes damaged or leaks in transit, the car- rier is required by federal regulations to isolate the package and to notify the Biohazards Control Office of the CDC in Atlanta, GA. The carrier must also notify the sender. Understandably, this can cause a significant delay in medical diagnosis and treatment</p>
			<p>Regulations regarding the mode of shipping or packaging, whether domestic or international, change frequently. Check with the laboratory for the most recent guidelines.</p>

		<h1>Normal Laboratory Values</h1>
		<p>Reference values (intervals) for blood, urine, CSF, stool, and other fluids (eg, gastric acid) and commonly used panels are included. (Note: The reference values provided in these tables should be used as guidelines only.) Reference values vary based on several factors, including the demographics of the healthy population from which specimens were obtained and the specific methods and/or instruments used to assay these specimens. Laboratories that are accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) are required to establish and/or validate their own reference values at least annually. Thus, any given result should be interpreted based on the reference value of the laboratory in which the test was done; the laboratory typically provides these values with the test result.</p>

		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>This noninvasive procedure visualizes all solid upper abdominal organs, including the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, appendix, pancreas, kidneys, adrenals, spleen, and the abdominal aorta and vena cava. Some diagnostic laboratories may perform organ-specific studies, such as renal or hepatobiliary ultrasound scans, together with abdominal ultrasound scanning. Specific large vessels (such as the renal and mesenteric artery and portal vein) may be evaluated using Doppler analysis.</p>
		<h4>Indications</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Evaluate abdominal pathologies associated with abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth, obstructions, fluid collections, infections with fever, weight loss, and generalized ill health.</li>
				<li>Characterize known or suspected masses and determine cause of jaundice.</li>
				<li>Screen for abdominal aortic aneurysms and stage known carcinomas.</li>
				<li>Provide guidance during biopsy, cyst aspiration, and other invasive procedures.</li>
			</ul>
		<h5>Reference values</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Normal position and appearance of the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas, kidneys, adrenals, and spleen, as well as the abdominal aorta, inferior vena cava, and their major tributaries.</li>
						<li>Sizes of organs</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Gallbladder: Length, diameter, and wall thickness within normal limits</li>
								<li>Liver: Anteroposterior (AP) diameter at the midclavicular line (ie, transverse) and length of the maximum right lobe (ie, sagittal) within normal limits</li>
								<li>Spleen: Width and length within normal limits</li>

						<li>Organ size, location, or structural abnormalities.</li>
						<li>Biliary tract obstruction, dilation, calculi, or hydronephrosis.</li>
						<li>One or more than two kidneys.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Interfering Factors</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Retained barium from prior x-ray studies may compromise the study.</li>
						<li>Intestinal gas overlying the area of interest interferes with sonographic visualization.</li>
						<li>Obesity adversely affects tissue visualization.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<h4>Procedure</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>A liberal coating of coupling agent (ie, gel) is applied to the skin so that there is no air between the skin and the transducer, which promotes sound transmission. The coupling agent also allows easy movement of the transducer over the skin</li>
				<li>In most laboratories, a handheld transducer is slowly moved across the skin of the area that is to be examined</li>
				<li>The patient is asked to lie quietly on an examination table and control breathing pattern. Scans are generally performed with the patient in the supine and decubitus positions</li>

		<h2>Arteriography</h2>
		<img src="img10/nurse30.png">
		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>Invasive X-ray Blood Vessel Imaging with Contrast; Interventional Procedures An arteriogram is an x-ray procedure requiring catheterization of certain vessels that can be used to demonstrate the vascular anatomy of specific areas in the body. Aortic, renal, carotid or vertebral, and femoral arteriograms are commonly performed. Venograms of the cavae, extremity veins, and veins of the abdomen are also performed. Interventional procedures include angioplasty, stent placement, abscess drainage, venous filter placement, tube placement, and tumor embolizations (eg, liver metastases, uterine fibroids).</p>
		<h4>Indications</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Assess vessel patency</li>
				<li>Determine presence of an aneurysm or arteriovenous shunting</li>
				<li>Assess vascularity of a known neoplasm</li>
				<li>Ensure vena cava filter placement</li>
				<li>Provide preoperative and postoperative evaluation for vascular and tumor surgery</li>
				<li>Provide nonsurgical intervention for known pathologies</li>
			</ul>
		<h5>Reference values</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Normal vascular anatomy, with no evidence of stenosis, aneurysm, or other arteriovenous malformation</li>
						<li>Normal carotid arteries, vertebral arteries, and abdominal aorta and its branches; normal renal and peripheral arteries</li>
					</ul>

				<p>Abnormal findings indicate the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stenosis or occlusion of vessels, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformations, incorrect placement of vena cava filter </li>
						<li>Intravascular or extravascular tumors or other masses • Pulmonary emboli and ulcerative plaque</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Interfering Factors</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Metallic objects that overlie the area of interest interfere with visualization of anatomy</li>
						<li>Patient motion interferes with image quality</li>
						<li>Severe obesity adversely affects image quality</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<h4>Procedures</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The patient is positioned on an operating table and IV access is maintained. Typically, ECG and a pulse oximeter are applied. Procedural/moderate sedation is administered</li>
				<li>Using sterile techniques and standard precautions, a local anesthetic is injected in the tissues surrounding the selected catheterization site</li>
				<li>Various guide wires and catheters are introduced into the blood vessel and directed under fluoroscopic guidance. An iodinated contrast agent is introduced into the blood vessel of choice while x-ray imaging is performed. When iodine contrast agents are contraindicated, some labs use sterile CO2 as an alternative</li>
				<li>Procedure time depends on the complexity of the examination and the patient’s condition. One hour is typical</li>
				<li>When the catheter is removed at the end of the exam, pressure is applied over the site</li>

		<h2>Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT Scan)</h2>
		<img src="img10/nurse31.png">
		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>X-ray Imaging with Contrast of Head and Body CT is a specialized procedure in which a thin beam of x-rays is directed at and moves around some stationary body part, with resultant computer-manipulated pictures that are not obscured by overlying anatomy</p>
		<h4>Indications</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>CT screening is done to detect the amount of calcium plaque in the coronary arteries and for the presence of lung masses</li>
				<li>Evaluate head trauma and rule out intracranial lesions, aneurysms, and hydrocephalus</li>
				<li>Evaluate prolonged, severe headache and changes in mental status</li>
				<li>Rule out pathologies within the abdomen, pelvis, spine, chest, or extremities</li>
				<li>Cancer staging and treatment planning</li>
				<li>Biopsy guidance</li>
			</ul>
		<h5>Reference Values</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal</li>
					<ul>
						<li>No apparent tumor or pathology</li>
						<li>Normal size, location, and appearance of body structures and organs</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Clinical Implications</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Head CT abnormalities refer to aneurysms, cysts, tumors, abscesses, intracranial hemorrhage, hematomas, hydrocephalus, fractures, and degenerative processes</li>
						<li>Body CT abnormalities refer to abscesses; neoplasms; metastases; cysts; enlarged lymph nodes; ascites; organ enlargement; aneurysms; diffuse changes as in cirrhosis or fatty liver; cancer of kidneys, spleen, pancreas, uterus, or prostate; collections of blood, fluid, or fat; retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy; or enlarged lymph nodes Skeletal CT abnormalities refer to bone metastasis and fractures</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Interfering Factors</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Patient movement results in suboptimal images</li>
						<li>Retained barium may obscure organs in upper and lower abdominal regions</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<h4>Procedures</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Head CT</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The patient lies on a motorized couch with the head supported in appropriate position. The couch is moved into a donut-shaped gantry that encases the x-ray apparatus and detectors</li>
						<li>Contrast is usually administered by intravenous injection</li>
						<li>Multiple images are taken while the patient remains motionless. Sedation and analgesics may be ordered if it is difficult for the patient to lie quietly. The total examination time is 10 to 30 minutes</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Body or Abdomen CT</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The procedure is the same as for the head, with the following exceptions. An oral contrast is consumed before the examination if the upper gastrointestinal tract is to be examined. Iodine contrast is usually administered intravenously for other examinations</li>
						<li>In CT scans of the spine, the protocol is similar except that CT of the spine performed to rule out fractures does not require contrast media administration or preparation. CT of spine for cord and paraspinous evaluation usually requires intrathecal contrast administration and may be performed in conjunction with a myelogram</li>
						<li>CT scans of the extremities may be ordered. No contrast or preparation is required if being performed to evaluate bony detail. Extremity CT scans performed for the assessment of soft tissue abnormalities may require contrast administration</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<h4>Nursing Interventions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Pretest</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Assess for test contraindications (pregnancy, iodine hypersensitivity), evidence of severe renal impairment (elevated BUN, creatinine), and food or beverage consumed within 4 hours before contrast administration</li>
						<li>Explain the examination purpose and procedure. Food and fluid restrictions before contrast-enhanced studies are generally indicated</li>
						<li>Special attention is necessary for diabetic patients. Because of pretest fasting, the administration of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be contraindicated. Check with the x-ray department</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Intratest</li>

					</ul>
			</ul>
		<h3>Clinical Alert</h3>
		<p>Diabetic patients who take the oral drug metformin (Glucophage) may require pre-procedure and post-procedure modifications. There is a potential for renal failure with lactic acidosis when iodinated contrast is administered in combination with metformin. Consult with the x-ray department to determine whether medications must be discontinued the day of and several days after the test</p>
		<h2>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h2>
		<img src="img10/nurse32.png">
		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>This diagnostic modality provides physiologic information and detailed anatomic views of tissues</p>
		<h4>Indications</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>To differentiate diseased tissue from healthy tissue and study blood flow</li>
				<li>Evaluate multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, spine and cord abnormalities, neoplasms throughout the body, joint pathologies, cardiac function, and vascular pathologies</li>
			</ul>
		<h5>Reference Values</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Normal soft tissue structures, brain, spinal cord, subarachnoid spaces (limbs, joints, fat, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels and marrow), heart, abdomen, and pelvis (particularly liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenals, kidneys, and reproductive organs).</li>
						<li>Blood vessels: normal size, anatomy, and hemodynamics</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Clinical Implications</li>
					<ul>
						<li>MRI of brain demonstrates white matter disease (multiple sclerosis, infections, AIDS), neoplasms, ischemia, cerebrovascular accident, aneurysms, hemorrhage; it is the test of choice to evaluate bone lesions and fractures</li>
						<li>MRI of spine demonstrates disc herniation, degeneration, neoplasms (primary and metastatic), inflammatory disease, and congenital abnormalities. No spinal contrast is needed</li>
						<li>MRI of limbs and joints demonstrates neoplasms, ligament or tendon damage, osteonecrosis, bone marrow disorders, and changes in blood flow</li>
						<li>MRI of heart (cardiac MRI) demonstrates abnormal chamber size and myocardial thickness, valves and coronary vessels, tumors, congenital heart disorders, pericarditis, graft patency (cardiac), thrombic disorders, aortic dissection, and cardiac ischemias</li>
						<li>MRI of abdomen and pelvis demonstrates neoplasms, especially useful in staging tumors, and tumor stage of abdominal organs, liver, pancreas, adrenals, spleen, kidneys, blood vessels, and abnormalities of renal transplants</li>
						<li>MRI angiography (reference to noninvasive angiography) demonstrates aneurysms, stenosis, occlusions, graft patency, and vascular malformations</li>
						<li>Functional MRI evaluates brain function while the patient is engaged in a task (eg, finger tapping) or auditory stimulus (eg, music) and may demonstrate abnormalities related to dementia, seizures, tumors, or strokes</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<h4>Procedure</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>For closed-system imaging, the patient is positioned (supine) before the couch is moved into tunnel-shaped gantry. The patient is assured that there is sufficient air to breathe and that he or she will be monitored during entire procedure</li>
				<li>Open MRI systems (less enclosed) may be used in some centers</li>
				<li>In some instances, a non-iodinated venous contrast is injected for better visualization of anatomy. The most commonly used contrast agents are gadolinium 50-DTPA, gadolinium manganese, or iron, which has very low toxicity and much fewer side effects than do iodine contrast agents. Gadolinium is generally used for examinations of the central nervous system (brain, vascular imaging, and spine).</li>
				<li>For abdominal or pelvic scans, glucagon may be administered to reduce bowel peristalsis</li>
				<li>Exam time will vary between 60 and 90 minutes</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Clinical Alert</h3>
		<p>Safety concerns for patient and staff during MRI procedures are based on the interaction of strong magnetic fields with body tissues and metallic objects. These potential hazards are mainly due to projectiles (metallic objects can be displaced, giving rise to potentially dangerous projectiles); torquing of metallic objects (implanted surgical clips and other metallic structures can be torqued or twisted within the body when exposed to strong magnetic fields); local heating (exposure to radiofrequency (RF) pulses can cause heating of tissues or metallic objects within patient’s body; for this reason, pregnant women are not routinely scanned since an increase in amniotic fluid/fetal temperature may be harmful); interference with electromechanical implants (electronic implants are at risk for damage from both magnetic fields and the radiofrequency (RF) pulses; consequently, those with cardiac pacemakers, implanted drug infusion pumps, cochlear implants, and similar devices should not be exposed to MRI procedures)</p>
		<h4>Nursing Interventions</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Pretest</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Explain MRI purpose, procedure, benefits, and risks</li>
						<li>Provide sedation if patient is claustrophobic or otherwise unable to lie still during procedure</li>
						<li>Assure the patient that a two-way communication system between the patient and the operator will allow for continual monitoring and vocal feedback</li>
						<li>Explain that fasting or drinking only clear liquids may be necessary for some MRI scans; also, no alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, or iron supplements may be taken before testing</li>

		<h2>Electrocardiogram</h2>
		<img src="img10/nurse36.png">
		<p>The SAE is an averaged ECG that adds hundreds of an individual’s ECGs together to detect small, late potentials that are indicative of arrhythmias.

		<h4>Indications</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify heart rhythm disturbances and myocardial ischemia</li>
				<li>Evaluate artificial pacemaker function</li>
				<li>Use SAE to identify persons at risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias, especially after myocardial infarction</li>
				<li>Use a vectorcardiogram to diagnose MI and determine hypertrophy or ventricular dilatation. It is more sensitive than an ECG</li>
			</ul>
		<h5>Reference Values</h5>

				<li>Clinical Implications</li>
					<ul>
						<li>ECG abnormalities fall into five categories: rhythm, rate, axis or position, hypertrophy, and infarct or ischemia</li>
						<li>SAE reveals the cause of syncope and can be positive for the presence of a late potential that may be associated with sustained ventricular tachycardia and sudden death</li>
						<li>Vectorcardiogram abnormalities appear in MI, hypertrophy, and intraventricular conduction</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Interfering Factors</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Race: False-positive findings of abnormalities can be more common in African Americans</li>
						<li>Anxiety or hyperventilation causes motion artifacts or morphology changes to the ECG</li>
						<li>Deep respiration may shift the heart’s position</li>
						<li>Exercise or movement: Strenuous exercise before ECG or muscle twitching can affect the waveform</li>
						<li>Ascites, excess body weight, and pregnancy can produce a left shift in QRS axis</li>
						<li>Medication or drug overdose and electrolyte imbalance•	For SAE, the patient’s movement and talking affect impulse gathering.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<h4>Procedures</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Gelled electrodes are placed on the extremities and the chest and attached to the recorder. 254 ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (EKG OR ECG)</li>

						<li>Evaluate outcomes and provide emotional support and explanations about possible further testing (eg, electrophysiology tests) to the patient, as needed. ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) 255</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		<h2>Clinical Alert</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The ECG does not show mechanical valvular function. It measures electrical impulses. It therefore may be normal in the presence of heart disease. An abnormal ECG may not necessarily signify heart disease, just as a normal ECG does not always reflect the absence of disease</li>
				<li>Pacemaker patients should be identified and documentation on the ECG should include whether a magnet was or was not used during the recording process</li>
				<li>A finding of late potentials in an SAE may be a predictor of sudden death</li>
