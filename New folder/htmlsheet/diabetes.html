		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Diabetes Mellitus or Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the β-cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia.</p>

		<h1>Types of Diabetes</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Type 1 Diabetes</li>
					<ul>
						<li>β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency) Immune-mediated diabetes</li>
						<li>Accounts for only 5–10% of those with diabetes, previously encompassed by the terms insulin-dependent diabetes, type I diabetes, or juvenile-onset diabetes, results from a cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the β-cells of the pancreas</li>
						<li>Markers of the immune destruction of the β-cell include islet cell autoantibodies, autoantibodies to insulin, autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), and autoantibodies to the tyrosine phosphatases IA-2 and IA-2β. One and usually more of these autoantibodies are present in 85–90% of individuals when fasting hyperglycemia is initially detected. Also, the disease has strong HLA associations, with linkage to the DQA and DQB genes, and it is influenced by the DRB genes. These HLA-DR/DQ alleles can be either predisposing or protective.</li>
						<li>In this form of diabetes, the rate of β-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (mainly infants and children) and slow in others (mainly adults).</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Some patients, particularly children and adolescents, may present with ketoacidosis as the first manifestation of the disease.</li>
								<li>Others have modest fasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycemia and/or ketoacidosis in the presence of infection or other stress.</li>
								<li>Adults, may retain residual β-cell function sufficient to prevent ketoacidosis for many years; such individuals eventually become dependent on insulin for survival and are at risk for ketoacidosis. At this latter stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, as manifested by low or undetectable levels of plasma C- peptide. Immune-mediated diabetes commonly occurs in childhood and adolescence, but it can occur at any age, even in the 8th and 9th decades of life. </li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>Type 2 Diabetes</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Ranging from predominantly insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to predominantly an insulin secretory defect with insulin resistance)</li>
						<li>This form of diabetes, which accounts for ∼90–95% of those with diabetes, previously referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes, type II diabetes, or adult-onset</li>
						<li>Encompasses individuals who have insulin resistance and usually have relative (rather than absolute) insulin deficiency At least initially, and often throughout their lifetime, these individuals do not need insulin treatment to survive. There are probably many different causes of this form of diabetes. Although the specific etiologies are not known, autoimmune destruction of β-cells does not occur, and patients do not have any of the other causes of diabetes listed above or below.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Most patients with this form of diabetes are obese, and obesity itself causes some degree of insulin resistance.</li>
								<li>Patients who are not obese by traditional weight criteria may have an increased percentage of body fat distributed predominantly in the abdominal region.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Ketoacidosis seldom occurs spontaneously in this type of diabetes; when seen, it usually arises in association with the stress of another illness such as infection.</li>
						<li>Frequently goes undiagnosed for many years because the hyperglycemia develops gradually and at earlier stages is often not severe enough for the patient to notice any of the classic symptoms of diabetes.</li>
						<li>Patients are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications.</li>
						<li>Patients with this form of diabetes may have insulin levels that appear normal or elevated, the higher blood glucose levels in these diabetic patients would be expected to result in even higher insulin values had their β-cell function been normal. Thus, insulin secretion is defective in these patients and insufficient to compensate for insulin resistance.</li>
						<li>Insulin resistance may improve with weight reduction and/or pharmacological treatment of hyperglycemia but is seldom restored to normal</li>
						<li>The risk of developing this form of diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Occurs more frequently in women with prior GDM and in individuals with hypertension or dyslipidemia</li>
								<li>Frequency varies in different racial/ethnic subgroups</li>
								<li>Often associated with a strong genetic predisposition, more so than is the autoimmune form of type 1 diabetes.</li>
								<li>However, the genetics of this form of diabetes are complex and not clearly defined.</li>

		<h1>Signs and Symptoms of Diabetes</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Polyuria, Polydipsia, Polyphagia</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Polyuria or increased urination. Polyuria occurs because the kidneys remove excess sugar from the blood, resulting in a higher urine production.</li>
						<li>Polydipsia or increased thirst. Polydipsia is present because the body loses more water as polyuria happens, triggering an increase in the patient’s thirst</li>
						<li>Polyphagia or increased appetite. Although the patient may consume a lot of food but glucose could not enter the cells because of insulin resistance or lack of insulin production.</li>
						<li>Hyperglycemia</li>
						<li>Weight loss</li>
						<li>Unexplained fatigue or lethargy</li>

						<td>Weight</td>
						<td>The fatter tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Inactivity</td>
						<td>The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Race</td>
						<td>Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Age</td>
						<td>Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Gestational diabetes</td>
						<td>If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Polycystic ovary syndrome</td>
						<td>For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes.</td>

						<td>High blood pressure</td>
						<td>Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels</td>
						<td>If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are.</td>
