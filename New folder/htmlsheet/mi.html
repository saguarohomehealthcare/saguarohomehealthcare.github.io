			<h1>Angina</h1>
				<ol>
					<ul>A.	Description</ul>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li>Angina is chest pain resulting from myocardial ischemia caused by inadequate myocardial blood and oxygen supply.</li>
								<li>Angina is caused by an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand</li>
								<li>Causes include obstruction of coronary blood flow resulting from atherosclerosis, coronary artery spasm, or conditions increasing myocardial oxygen consumption.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					<p><b>Note:The goal of treatment for angina is to provide relief from the acute attack, correct the imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, and prevent the progression of the disease and further attacks to reduce the risk of MI.</b></p>
					<ul>B.	Patterns of Angina</ul>
						<ol>
							<ul>I.	Stable angina - Also called exertional angina b. Occurs with activities that involve exertion or emotional stress; relieved with rest or nitroglycerin c. Usually has a stable pattern of onset, duration, severity, and relieving factors</ul>
							<ul>II.	Unstable angina - Also called preinfarction angina. Occurs with an unpredictable degree of exertion or emotion and increases in occurrence, duration, and severity over time. Pain may not be relieved with nitroglycerin</ul>
							<ul>III.	Variant angina - Also called Prinzmetal’s or vasospastic angina b. Results from coronary artery spasm c. May occur at rest d. Attacks may be associated with ST- segment elevation noted on the electrocardiogram (ECG).</ul>
							<ul>IV.	Intractable angina is a chronic, incapacitating angina unresponsive to interventions.</ul>
							<ul>V.	Preinfarction angina - Associated with acute coronary insufficiency b. Lasts longer than 15 minutes c. Symptom of worsening cardiac ischemia d. Characterized by chest pain that occurs days to weeks before an MI</ul>
							<ul>VI.	Silent ischemia: objective evidence of ischemia (such as electrocardiographic changes with a stress test), but patient reports no symptoms</ul>

						<tr>
							<td>6.1	Monitor and document characteristic of pain, noting verbal reports, nonverbal cues (moaning, crying, grimacing, restlessness, diaphoresis, clutching of chest) and BP or heart rate changes.</td>
							<td>Variation of appearance and behavior of patients in pain may present a challenge in assessment. Most patients with an acute MI appear ill, distracted, and focused on pain. Verbal history and deeper investigation of precipitating factors should be postponed until pain is relieved. Respirations may be increased as a result of pain and associated anxiety; release of stress-induced Catecholamines increases heart rate and BP.</td>
							<td>• Reports beginning relief of chest discomfort and symptoms at once 
							• Appears comfortable and pain or symptom free: Is rested Respiratory rate, cardiac rate, and blood pressure return to pre-discomfort level Skin warm and dry</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6.2	Obtain full description of pain from patient including location, intensity (using scale of 0–10), duration, characteristics (dull, crushing, described as “like an elephant in my chest”), and radiation. Assist patient to quantify pain by comparing it to other experiences.<br>
							6.3	The effect of chest discomfort on cardiovascular perfusion—to the heart (eg, change in blood pressure, heart sounds), to the brain (eg, changes in LOC), to the kidneys (eg, decrease in urine output), and to the skin (eg, color, temperature).</td>
							<td>6.2	Pain is a subjective experience and must be described by patient. Provides baseline for comparison to aid in determining effectiveness of therapy, resolution and progression of problem.<br>6.3 MI decreases myocardial contractility and ventricular compliance and may produce dysrhythmias. Cardiac output is reduced, resulting in reduced blood pressure and decreased organ perfusion. The heart rate may increase as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output.</td>
							<td>Adequate cardiac output as evidenced by: 
							Heart rate and rhythm 
							Blood pressure 
							Mentation 
							Urine output 
							Serum BUN and creatinine Skin color, temperature, and moisture 
							Is pain and symptom free</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6.4	Review history of previous angina , anginal equivalent, or MI pain. Discuss family history if pertinent.</td>
							<td>6.4	Delay in reporting pain hinders pain relief and may require increased dosage of medication to achieve relief. In addition, severe pain may induce shock by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system, thereby creating further damage and interfering with diagnostics and relief of pain.</td>
							<td>Is pain and symptom free</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6.5	Instruct patient to report pain immediately. Provide quiet environment, calm activities, and comfort measures. Approach patient calmly and confidently.</td>
							<td>6.5	Decreases external stimuli, which may aggravate anxiety and cardiac strain, limit coping abilities and adjustment to current situation.</td>
							<td>Is pain and symptom free</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6.6	Ensure physical rest: use of the bedside commode with assistance; backrest elevated to promote comfort; diet as tolerated; arms supported during upper extremity activity; use of stool softener to prevent straining at stool. Provide a restful environment, and allay fears and anxiety by being supportive, calm, and competent. Individualized visitation, based on patient response.</td>
							<td>6.6	Physical rest reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Fear and anxiety precipitate the stress response; this results in increased levels of endogenous catecholamines, which increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Also, with increased epinephrine, the pain threshold is decreased, and pain increases myocardial oxygen consumption.</td>
							<td>Is pain and symptom free Reports feeling comfortable</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6.7	Instruct patient to do relaxation techniques: deep and slow breathing, distraction behaviors, visualization, guided imagery. Assist as needed.</td>
							<td>6.8 Helpful in decreasing perception and response to pain. Provides a sense of having some control over the situation, increase in positive attitude.</td>
							<td>Reports feeling of comfort</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6.8 Check vital signs before and after narcotic medication.</td>
							<td>6.8 Hypotension and respiratory depression can occur as a result of narcotic administration. These problems may increase myocardial damage in presence of ventricular insufficiency.</td>
							<td>VS are within normal values</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6.9 Administer supplemental oxygen by means of nasal cannula or face mask, as indicated.</td>
							<td>6.9 Increases amount of oxygen available for myocardial uptake and thereby may relieve discomfort associated with tissue ischemia.</td>
							<td>No signs of respiratory difficulties</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>6.10	Initially, every 4 hours, and with chest discomfort or symptoms, assess, document, and report to the physician abnormal heart sounds (particularly S3 and S4 gallops and the holosystolic murmur of left ventricular papillary muscle dysfunction), abnormal breath sounds (particularly crackles), and patient intolerance to specific activities.</td>
							<td>6.10 These data are useful in diagnosing left ventricular failure. Diastolic filling sounds (S3 and S4 gallop) result from decreased left ventricular compliance associated with MI. Papillary muscle dysfunction (from infarction of the papillary muscle) can result in mitral regurgitation and a reduction in stroke volume, leading to left ventricular failure. The presence of crackles (usually at the lung bases) may indicate pulmonary congestion from increased left heart pressures. The association of symptoms and activity can be used as a guide for activity prescription and a basis for patient teaching.</td>
							<td>
								<ul>
									<li>No shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea</li>

							<td>Important second-line agents for pain control through effect of blocking sympathetic stimulation, thereby reducing heart rate, systolic BP, and myocardial oxygen demand.May be given alone or with nitrates. Note: beta-blockers may be contraindicated if myocardial contractility is severely impaired, because negative inotropic properties can further reduce contractility.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Analgesics: morphine, meperidine (Demerol)</td>
							<td>Although intravenous (IV) morphine is the usual drug of choice, other injectable narcotics may be used in acute-phase and/or recurrent chest pain unrelieved by nitroglycerin to reduce severe pain, provide sedation, and decrease myocardial workload. IM injections should be avoided, if possible, because they can alter the CPK diagnostic indicator and are not well absorbed in under perfused tissue.</td>
