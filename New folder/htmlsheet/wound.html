							<ul>
								<li>Begins at the time of injury and lasts 3 to 5 days; manifestations include local edema, pain, redness, and warmth.</li>
								<li>Hemostasis (bleeding stops)</li>
								<li>Inflammation (redness, swelling, warmth and pain maybe present) Phagocytosis (WBC’s engulf bacteria and foreign debris) Growth factor stimulation</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Fibroblastic/Proliferation</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Begins the fourth day after injury and lasts 2 to 4 weeks(3-21 days); scar tissue forms and granulation tissue forms in the tissue bed.</li>
								<li>Epithelialization</li>
								<li>Contraction</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Maturation</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Begins as early as 3 weeks after the injury and may last for 1 year; scar tissue becomes thinner and is firm and inelastic on palpation.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>Healing by intention</li>
					<ul>
						<li>First Intention</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Wound edges are approximated and held in place (i.e., with sutures) until healing occurs; wound is easily closed and dead space is eliminated.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Second Intention</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This type of healing occurs with injuries or wounds that have tissue loss and require gradual filling in of the dead space with connective tissue.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Third Intention</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This type of healing involves delayed primary closure and occurs with wounds that are intentionally left open for several days for irrigation or removal of debris and exudates; once debris has been removed and inflammation resolves, the wound is closed by first intention.</li>
							</ul>
						<p class="italic">*The healing process varies depending on the stage of the pressure ulcer. Stage I & II pressure ulcers and partial thickness wounds heal by tissue regeneration. Stage III & IV pressure ulcers and full thickness wounds heal by scar formation and contraction. Data indicate a 20% reduction in wound size over two weeks is a reliable predictive indicator of healing. (Flanagan 2003)</p>

						<li>Serous</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Clear or straw colored</li>
								<li>Occurs as a normal part of the healing process</li>

						<li>Serosanguineous</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Pink colored due to the presence of a small amouont of blood cells mixed with serous drainage</li>
								<li>Occurs as a normal part of the healing process</li>

		<h1>Wound Healing</h1>
			<h2>Reasons why Wounds will not Heal</h2>
				<p>A non-healing wound is generally defined as a wound that will not heal within four weeks. If a wound does not heal within this usual time period, the cause is usually found in underlying conditions that have either gone unnoticed or untreated. In general, there are five reasons why wounds will not heal and more than one of these conditions can be operating at the same time.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Poor Circulation</h3></li>
						<p>Wounds heal most efficiently when there is easy access to and from the wound site through the body's circulatory system. Here, the two issues impeding the healing process are arterial insufficiency, where there is compromised blood flow to a wound site through the arteries; and venous insufficiency, where spent blood and fluids cannot return up through the veins.</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Infection</h3></li>
						<p>Infection is the proliferation of bacteria, virus or fungus in or under a wound site that inhibits the natural and timely healing of the wound. Normally, when these invaders enter a wound site they are quickly overtaken and destroyed by the millions of fresh white blood cells the body makes every day.</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Edema</h3></li>
						<p>Edema is fluid that accumulates in the skin, dermis or fatty tissue and usually occurs in the lower extremities. This fluid build up is typically due to venous insufficiency (poor venous return) and is a risk for developing sores (venous ulcers). Once those sores form, edema is also a major barrier to healing by blocking the flow of nutrients to and from the area.</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Protein Malnutrition</h3></li>
						<p>Just as you cannot build a house without the building blocks, bricks or foundation, the body cannot build new tissues without an adequate supply of protein. In fact, insufficient nutrition is, by far, the most overlooked reason why wounds will not heal.</p>
						<p>Treating the outside of wounds with grafts, flaps, special compression wraps and debriding agents can only heal wounds to the degree that there is adequate nutrition inside the body. So with malnutrition and insufficient protein intake, the wound-healing process is fundamentally halted until these insufficiencies are corrected.</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Repetitive Trauma to the Wound</h3></li>
						<p>When a wound undergoes repetitive pressure due to bumping or rubbing against a surface, it is said to be undergoing repetitive trauma. This can lengthen the healing process or stop it completely. This problem is magnified in paraplegic patients since they cannot feel if one or both of their feet are continuously bumping on their wheelchair, for example.</p>
						<p>Similarly, in spinal cord injury patients, pressure ulcers can develop due to lack of body movement such as when they are sleeping in the same position night after night without the ability to shift, or even when watching a two-hour movie without repositioning.</p>
					</ul>

		<h1>Types of Wound</h1>
			<h2>Pressure Ulcer</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Previously called decubitus or bed sore, a pressure ulcer is the result of damage caused by pressure over time causing an ischemia of underlying structures.</li>
					<li>Bony prominences are the most common sites and causes.</li>
					<li>There are many risk factors that contribute to the development of pressure ulcers. CMS (Centers For Medicare And Medicaid Services (New Name For The HCFA,2004) recommends patients in LTC be assessed for risk on admission, weekly for the first four weeks then reassessed quarterly.</li>
				<h3>Contributing Factors for Pressure Ulcer</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Intrinsic contributing factors include:</li>
							<ol>
								<li>Malnutrition</li>
								<li>Dehydration</li>
								<li>Impaired mobility</li>
								<li>Chronic conditions</li>
								<li>Impaired sensation</li>
								<li>Deceased LOC</li>
								<li>Infection</li>
								<li>Advance age</li>
								<li>Steroid use</li>
								<li>Pressure ulcer present</li>
							</ol>
						<li>External contributing factors include:</li>
							<ol>
								<li>Pressure</li>
								<li>Friction</li>
								<li>Moisture</li>
								<li>Incontinence</li>
								<li>Shear</li>
							</ol>
					</ul>
				<h3>Prevention of Pressure Ulcer (WOCN 2003; AHCPR 1992)</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Proper skin care is crucial and involves inspecting skin daily and an individualized bathing schedule, using warm (not hot) water and mild soap. Avoid massage over bony prominences and use lubricants if skin is dry.</li>
						<li>Managing pressure is also necessary and the following is recommended.</li>
						<li>Provide appropriate support surface</li>
						<li>Reposition every two hours in bed</li>
						<li>Off-load heels - use pillows or positioning boot</li>
						<li>Reposition every hour when in chair</li>
						<li>Use pillow between legs for side lying</li>
						<li>Do not position directly on trochanter</li>
						<li>Do not use doughnut-type devices</li>
						<li>Friction and shear need to be reduced. Friction is the mechanical force exerted when skin is dragged against a coarse surface while shear is the mechanical force caused by the interplay of gravity and friction. It exerts a force parallel to the skin resulting in angulation and stretching of blood vessels (shown below on right) within the sub-dermal tissues, causing thrombosis and cellular death. This manifests as necrosis and 		undermining of the deepest layers (Pieper 2007).</li>
						<li>To reduce friction and shear, the following is recommended:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Use draw sheets for repositioning</li>
								<li>Encourage use of trapeze if possible</li>
								<li>Keep head of bed elevated, 30 degrees if tolerated</li>
								<li>Elevate foot of bed slightly, if condition permits</li>
								<li>Use pillow or wedge to support hip for 30? side-lying, lateral position</li>
								<li>Utilize lifts and transfer devices</li>
								<li>Rehabilitation or Restorative care if indicated</li>
								<li>Manage Incontinence</li>
								<li>Timely cleansing</li>
								<li>Apply barrier ointment to intact skin</li>
								<li>If skin is red or denuded use a paste</li>
								<li>Use appropriate incontinence disposables</li>
								<li>Apply fecal incontinence pouch if needed</li>
							</ul>
					</ol>
				</ul>
			<h2>Non-pressure Ulcer</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Skin tears, denuded or excoriated skin, arterial ulcers, venous stasis ulcers and diabetic/neurotrophic ulcers are NOT pressure ulcers</li>
					<li>Skin Tear Prevention (Ayello 2003)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Wash with gentle cleansing products</li>
							<li>Use emollients on skin</li>
							<li>Ensure adequate hydration/nutrition</li>
							<li>Transfer techniques to avoid friction/shear</li>
							<li>Support dangling extremities</li>
							<li>Avoid use of adhesive products on skin</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Venous Ulcer Prevention (Vowden & Vowden 2006)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Use of compression stockings (contraindicated if ABI < 0.5)</li>
							<li>Elevation of effected leg above level of the heart at rest</li>
							<li>Avoid use of products likely to be sensitizers (lanolin, fragrances)</li>
							<li>Avoid trauma to legs</li>
							<li>Calf muscle strengthening</li>
							<li>Regular follow up to monitor ABI</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Prevention of Limb loss in Lower extremity arterial disease (Hopf et al. 2006)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Consistent use of protective footwear</li>
							<li>Avoid friction, shear or trauma to feet/legs</li>
							<li>Apply emollients to keep skin pliable</li>
							<li>Avoid cold, caffeine, nicotine and constrictive garments</li>
							<li>Planned graduated walking program</li>
							<li>No use of thermal devices</li>
							<li>Routine professional foot care</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Prevention of neuropathic ulcers (Steed et al. 2006)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Control diabetes</li>
							<li>Daily care and inspection of feet</li>
							<li>Wear well-fitting protective footwear</li>
							<li>Avoid application of external heat</li>
							<li>Avoid use of OTC meds for corns/callous</li>

	<div class="container" id="assessment">
		<h1>Assessment (Nix 2007)</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Holistic Assessment</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Holistic assessment of a patient with a wound includes systemic factors, psychosocial factors, and local factors.</li>
						<li>Systemic factors assess etiology, duration, and decreased oxygenation or perfusion of the wound as well as comorbid conditions, medications, and host infection of the patient.</li>
						<li>Psychosocial factors to address in a holistic assessment include the patient’s knowledge deficits, cultural beliefs and financial constraints including a lack of or insufficient health insurance. Additionally, it is necessary to assess whether the patient has impaired access to appropriate resources and any social support – family, significant others or community resources.</li>
						<li>Local factors to assess include desiccation, excess exudates, low wound temperature, recurrent trauma (also friction & pressure), infection, and necrosis and foreign bodies.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Wound Assessment</li>
					<ul>
						<li>An assessment of the wound should be done weekly and be used to drive treatment decisions.</li>
						<li>Wound assessment includes: location, class/stage, size, base tissues, exudates, odor, edge/perimeter, pain and an evaluation for infection.</li>
						<li>Location - Documentation of location indicating which extremity, nearest bony prominence or anatomical landmark is necessary for appropriate monitoring of wounds. (Hess 2005)</li>
						<li>Class/Stage - Pressure ulcers are classified by stages as defined by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP). Originally there were four stages (I-IV) but in February 2007 these stages were revised and two more categories were added, deep tissue injury and unstageable.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Pressure Ulcer Staging</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Stage I - Intact skin with non-blanchable redness of a localized area, usually over a bony prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching; its color may differ from the surrounding area.</li>
						<li>Stage II - Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red/pink wound bed, without slough. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum filled blister.</li>
						<li>Stage III - Full thickness skin loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscle is not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining/tunneling.</li>
						<li>Stage IV - Full thickness skin loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Often include undermining and tunneling.</li>
						<li>Unstageable - Full thickness tissue loss in which the base of the ulcer is covered by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown or black) in the wound bed.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Tissue Injury (Suspected Deep)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact skin or blood-filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear. The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. (NPUAP 2/07)</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Class</li>
				<p>There are a number of classification and grading systems used in wound care but the simplest method uses the terms partial thickness or full thickness</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Partial thickness wound (PTW): damage to epidermis and/or dermis only</li>
						<li>Full thickness wound (FTW): damage to subcutaneous layer or deeper</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Size Measurement</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Length – from top edge to the bottom edge (head to toe) at longest point</li>
						<li>Width – from edge to edge perpendicular to the length at widest point</li>
						<li>Depth – straight in, perpendicular to the base, at deepest point</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Undermining/Tunneling</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Using the “clock concept” (12 o’clock is in the direction of the patient’s head and 6 o’clock is toward the feet)</li>
						<li>Where does it start and where does it end (clockwise direction)</li>
						<li>Tunnel depth is at its deepest point</li>
						<li>Location of deepest point</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Base Tissues</li>
				<p>Assessing the appearance of tissue in the wound bed is critical for determining appropriate treatment strategies and to evaluate progress toward healing. (Keast et al. 2004)</p>
				<li>Necrosis/Eschar</li>
				<p>Black, brown or tan devitalized tissue that adheres to the wound bed or edges and may be firmer or softer than the surrounding skin.</p>
				<li>Slough</li>
				<p>Soft, moist avascular tissue that adheres to the wound bed in strings or thick clumps; may be white, yellow, tan or green.</p>
				<li>Granulation</li>
				<p>Pink/red moist tissue comprised of new blood vessels, collagen fibers and fibroblasts. Typically, the surface is shiny and moist with a granular appearance.</p>
				<li>Epithelium</li>
				<p>New pink and shin tissue/skin that grows in from the edges or as islands on the wound surface.</p>
				<li>Exudates</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Amount</li>
							<ul>
								<li>None – base and dressing dry</li>
								<li>Slight – small amount in center of dressing</li>
								<li>Moderate – contained within the dressing</li>
								<li>Copious – extends beyond dressing onto clothing or bed linen</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Type</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Serous – thin, watery, clear or straw colored</li>
								<li>Serosanguineous – thin, pale red to pink</li>
								<li>Purulent – thick, opaque, tan, yellow to green and may have an offensive odor</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="italic">*Consider treatment modality and frequency of dressing changes</p>
						<li>Odor</li>
						<p>Assess after cleansing (Garcia & Thomas 2006). Extreme malodor, especially if accompanied by purulent exudates is suggestive of infection. Most wounds do have an odor. The type of dressing can affect odor as well as hygiene and the presence of nonviable tissue (Keast et al. 2004).</p>
						<li>Edge/Perimeter</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Describe wound edges (approximated, rolled, calloused)</li>
								<li>Describe periwound skin (indurated, erythematous, macerated, healthy)</li>
								<li>Describe presence of excoriation, denudement, erosion, papules, pustules or other lesions</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Induration</li>
						<p>Abnormal hardening of the tissue caused by consolidation of edema, this may be a sign of underlying infection.</p>
					</ol>
				<li>Erythema</li>
				<p>Redness of surrounding tissue may be normal in the inflammatory stage of healing. However, if accompanied by an increase in temperature of tissue, exudates or pain may also be a sign of infection</p>
				<li>Maceration</li>
				<p>Caused by excessive moisture, Tissue loses its pigmentation (appears lucid or turns white) and becomes soft and friable.</p>
				<li>Pain</li>
				<p>A critical aspect of local wound assessment both from the perspective of the patient and as a clinical indicator of infection. (Reddy, Keast, Fowler & Sibbald 2003) Include location, type/cause, rating (use validated scale), patient description and nonverbal signs.</p>
				<li>Evaluation of infection</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Signs and Symptoms:Redness, warmth and induration of adjacent tissues</li>
						<li>Pain or tenderness</li>
						<li>Dysmorphic and/or friable granulation</li>
						<li>Unusual odor</li>
						<li>Purulent exudates</li>
						<li>Systemic signs (fever, chills, sweats)</li>
						<li>When to Culture: (Dow 2003) - When signs of infection are present or when a clean wound fails to heal</li>
						<li>Always cleanse wound first</li>
					</ol>
				<li>Additional Assessment for Lower Extremity Wounds (WOCN 2002)</li>
				<p>Physical Exam</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Edema –extent and persistence of pitting (1+ - 4+)</li>

							<ul>
								<li>Use barrier products to protect from adhesives and moisture</li>
								<li>Change dressings at appropriate intervals to avoid pooling of exudates</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Prevent and Manage Infection</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Critical colonization can result in failure to heal, poor quality tissue, increased friability and increased drainage (Frank, Bayoumi & Westendorp 2005). Determining whether the wound has a bacterial imbalance (critical colonization and infection) is of primary importance to healing (Sibbald, Woo & Ayello 2006).</li>
								<li>Superficial increased bacterial burden – topical agent with low toxicity, not likely to cause allergy and not associated with bacterial resistance. Surrounding skin compartment infection – topical agent, swab culture and appropriate oral antibiotic agent (Sibbald 2003)</li>
								<li>Deep wound infection or osteomyelitis – parenteral antibiotics. Also consider tissue culture and additional lab tests (Frank et al. 2005)</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>Removal of Nonviable Tissue (Debridement)</li>
				<p>Removes growth medium, controls/ prevents infection, defines extent of the wound and stimulates the healing process.</p>

							</ul>
						<li>Post-procedure interventions</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Place specimen in the appropriate container and send to pathology laboratory for analysis.</li>
								<li>Use surgically aseptic technique for biopsy site dressings.</li>
								<li>Assess the biopsy site for bleeding and infection.</li>
								<li>Instruct the client to keep dressing in place for at least 8 hours, and then clean daily and use antibiotic ointment as prescribed (sutures are usually removed in 7 to 10 days).</li>
								<li>Instruct the client to report signs of excessive drainage or redness or other signs of infection.</li>
							</ul>
					</ol>
				<li>Skin/wound cultures</li>
					<ol>
						<li>A small skin culture sample is obtained with a sterile applicator and the appropriate type of culture tube (e.g., bacterial or viral). Methods include scraping, punch biopsy, and collecting fluid.</li>
						<li>Post-procedure intervention</li>
						<li>Viral culture is placed immediately on ice.</li>
						<li>Sample is sent to laboratory to identify an existing organism.</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="italic">*Obtain skin culture samples or any other type of culture specimens before instituting antibiotic therapy.</p>
				<li>Wood’s light examination</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Description: Skin is viewed under ultraviolet light through a special glass (Wood’s glass) to identify superficial infections of the skin.</li>
						<li>Pre-procedure intervention: Darken the room before the examination.</li>
						<li>Post-procedure intervention: Assist the client during adjustment from the darkened room.</li>
					</ol>
				<li>Diascopy</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Technique allows clearer inspection of lesions by eliminating the erythema caused by increased blood flow to the area.</li>
						<li>A glass slide is pressed over the lesion, causing blanching and revealing the lesion more clearly.</li>
