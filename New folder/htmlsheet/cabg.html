		<p>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. Surgeons use CABG to treat people who have severe coronary heart disease (CHD). CABG is one treatment for CHD(Coronary Heart Disease). During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from the body is connected, or grafted, to the blocked coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This creates a new path for oxygen-rich blood to flow to the heart muscle. Surgeons can bypass multiple coronary arteries during one surgery.</p>

			<p>This is a recurring acute chest pain or discomfort resulting from decreased blood supply to the heart muscle (Myocardial ischemia).  There is an increasing demand of oxygen but heart cannot supply.  Generally, this is due to obstruction or spasm of coronary arteries.</p>

		<h2>Types of Angina</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3>Stable Angina</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>effort-induced pain, emotional stress relieved by rest</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<h3>Unstable angina</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>pain occurs with increasing frequency; diminishes patient’s ability to work and may signal incoming MI.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<h3>Variant angina</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>pain due to coronary artery spasm; not stress-induced</li>
					</ul>

		<h2>Symptoms of Angina</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Severe chests discomfort (heaviness, pressure, tightness, choking and squeezing)</li>
				<li>Sweating</li>

						<td>Physical examination Blood Test</td>
						<td>Your doctor also may ask you about any symptoms you have, such as chest pain or shortness of breath. He or she will want to know how often and for how long your symptoms occur.CRP ( C-Reactive Protein )in the blood may increase the risk for CAD and heart attack.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>ECG</td>
						<td>is a simple test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Echocardiogram</td>
						<td>Uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.Echo also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.There are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done both before and after a stress test. A stress echo usually is done to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of CHD</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Stress Test</td>
						<td>Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate.The heart tests done during stress testing may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Coronary angiography and Cardiac Catheterization</td>
						<td>is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through the coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study blood flow through the heart and blood vessels. This helps your doctor find blockages that can cause a heart attack.</td>

						<td>Expected or transient reactions (low backache, localized numbness and reddening or skin indentations).</td>
						<td>Minor effects of immobilization and positioning should resolve in 24 hr. If they persist, medical evaluation is required.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Inform patient or SO about itinerary, physician/SO communications.</td>
						<td>Logistical information about operating room (OR) schedule and locations (recovery room, postoperative room assignment), as well as where and when the surgeon will communicate with SO relieves stress and mis-communications, preventing confusion and doubt over patient’s well-being.</td>

						<td>Discuss individual postoperative pain management plan. Identify misconceptions patient may have and provide appropriate information.</td>
						<td>Increases likelihood of successful pain management. Some patients may expect to be pain-free or fear becoming addicted to narcotic agents.</td>
