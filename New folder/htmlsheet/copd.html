		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
		<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD is a chronic lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. Increasingly common, affecting millions of Americans, and is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. COPD is often preventable and treatable. This is a disease where patient has difficulty in emptying air out of the lungs (airflow obstruction) can lead to shortness of breath or feeling tired because you are working harder to breathe. COPD is a term that is used to include chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or a combination of both conditions. Asthma is also a disease where it is difficult to empty the air out of the lungs, but asthma is not included in the definition of COPD. It is not uncommon, however for a patient with COPD to also have some degree of asthma.</p>

				<tr>
					<td>Auscultate breath sounds. Note adventitious breath sounds (wheezes, crackles, rhonchi).</td>
					<td>Some degree of bronchospasm is present with obstructions in airway and may or may not be manifested in adventitious breath sounds such as scattered, moist crackles (bronchitis); faint sounds, with expiratory wheezes (emphysema); or absent breath sounds (severe asthma).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Assess and monitor respirations and breath sounds, noting rate and sounds (tachypnea, stridor, crackles, wheezes). Note inspiratory and expiratory ratio.</td>
					<td>Tachypnea is usually present to some degree and may be pronounced on admission or during stress or concurrent acute infectious process. Respirations may be shallow and rapid, with prolonged expiration in comparison to inspiration.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Note presence and degree of dyspnea as for reports of “air hunger,” restlessness, anxiety, respiratory distress, use of accessory muscles. Use 0–10 scale or American Thoracic Society’s “Grade of Breathlessness Scale” to rate breathing difficulty. Ascertain precipitating factors when possible. Differentiate acute episode from exacerbation of chronic dyspnea.</td>
					<td>Respiratory dysfunction is variable depending on the underlying process such as infection, allergic reaction, and the stage of chronicity in a patient with established COPD. Note: Using a 0–10 scale to rate dyspnea aids in quantifying and tracking changes in respiratory distress. Rapid onset of acute dyspnea may reflect pulmonary embolus</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Assist patient to assume position of comfort (elevate head of bed, have patient lean on overbed table or sit on edge of bed)</td>
					<td>Elevation of the head of the bed facilitates respiratory function by use of gravity; however, patient in severe distress will seek the position that most eases breathing. Supporting arms and legs with table, pillows, and so on helps reduce muscle fatigue and can aid chest expansion</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>	
					<td>Keep environmental pollution to a minimum such as dust, smoke, and feather pillows, according to individual situation.</td>
					<td>Precipitators of allergic type of respiratory reactions that can trigger or exacerbate onset of acute episode</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Encourage abdominal or pursed-lip breathing exercises.</td>
					<td>Provides patient with some means to cope with or control dyspnea and reduce air-trapping</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Observe characteristics of cough (persistent, hacking, moist). Assist with measures to improve effectiveness of cough effort.</td>
					<td>Cough can be persistent but ineffective, especially if patient is elderly, acutely ill, or debilitated. Coughing is most effective in an upright or in a head-down position after chest percussion.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Increase fluid intake to 3000 mL per day within cardiac tolerance. Provide warm or tepid liquids. Recommend intake of fluids between, instead of during, meals.</td>
					<td>Hydration helps decrease the viscosity of secretions, facilitating expectoration. Using warm liquids may decrease bronchospasm. Fluids during meals can increase gastric distention and pressure on the diaphragm.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Monitor and graph serial ABGs, pulse oximetry, chest x-ray</td>
					<td>Establishes baseline for monitoring progression or regression of disease process an complications. Note:  Pulse oximetry readings detect changes in saturation as they are happening, helping to identify trends before patient is symptomatic. However, studies have shown that the accuracy of pulse oximetry may be questioned if patient has severe peripheral vasoconstriction</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Position head midline with flexion on appropriate for age/condition</td>
					<td>To gain or maintain open airway</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Elevate Head of Bed</td>
					<td>To decrease pressure on the diaphragm and enhancing drainage</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Observe S/Sx of infections</td>
					<td>To identify infectious process</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Auscultate breath sounds & assess air movement</td>
					<td>To ascertain status & note progress</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Instruct the patient to increase fluid intake</td>
					<td>To help to liquefy secretions</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Demonstrate effective coughing and deep-breathing techniques</td>
					<td>To maximize effort</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Keep back dry</td>
					<td>To prevent further complications</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Turn the patient q 2 hours</td>
					<td>To prevent possible aspirations</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Demonstrate chest physiotherapy, such as bronchial tapping when in cough, proper postural drainage</td>
					<td>These techniques will prevent possible aspirations and prevent any untoward complications</td>
