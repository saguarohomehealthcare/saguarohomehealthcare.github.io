			<p id="chfparagraph">Known as Chronic Heart Failure or Congestive Cardiac Failure. It is a condition that the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently in your body. The heart's main pumping chambers become thicker or larger hencce can not relax or contract as they should. This leads to fluid retention in the lungs, abdomen, legs and other parts of the body.</p>

			<p>Acute myocardial infarction is the medical name for a heart attack. A heart attack is a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood flow to the heart is abruptly cut off, causing tissue damage. This is usually the result of a blockage in one or more of the coronary arteries. A blockage can develop due to a buildup of plaque, a substance mostly made of fat, cholesterol, and cellular waste products</p>

			<p>Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Bacterial pneumonia is the most common type in adults. Pneumonia causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.</p>

			<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD is a chronic lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. Increasingly common, affecting millions of Americans, and is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. COPD is often preventable and treatable. This is a disease where patient has difficulty in emptying air out of the lungs (airflow obstruction) can lead to shortness of breath or feeling tired because you are working harder to breathe. COPD is a term that is used to include chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or a combination of both conditions. Asthma is also a disease where it is difficult to empty the air out of the lungs, but asthma is not included in the definition of COPD. It is not uncommon, however for a patient with COPD to also have some degree of asthma.</p>

			<img src="img/cabg.png" alt="picture of cabg">
			<p>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. Surgeons use CABG to treat people who have severe coronary heart disease (CHD). CABG is one treatment for CHD(Coronary Heart Disease). During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from the body is connected, or grafted, to the blocked coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This creates a new path for oxygen-rich blood to flow to the heart muscle. Surgeons can bypass multiple coronary arteries during one surgery.</p>
